One of my favorite things to do is to stand in front of my white board in my living room and pretend I am teaching something I just learned to a large audience.  In reality, the only things listening are my daughter's hair brush and some dirty clothes lying on the the floor. Teaching an actual audience would be way more frightening.

I decided, howere, that it might not be a bad idea to document what I learned somehow and put it out there on the interwebs.  So instead of a 100% guarantee that no one is benefitting from one I am teaching, there is a half percent chance that someone comes across it and gets some value from it.

These learning log entries will be summaries of things am learning in my own words. The proper attribution will be given.  They will be nothing in-depth - just a different way of looking at material that you may be learning as well that could benefit by giving you a different perspective.
